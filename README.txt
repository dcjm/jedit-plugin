PolyML Plugin 0.1.0
-------------------

This is a plugin under development for working with PolyML. 

build.xml is the ant makefile.

There are currently two parts to this code: 

1. ShellBuffer: you can create a shell-buffer for an emacs-style interaction with an ML shell.  

2. PolyMLProcess which interacts with PolyML 5.3/development version using this --ideprotocol setting. see: http://www.polyml.org/docs/IDEProtocol.html
