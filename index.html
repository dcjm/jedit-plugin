<h1>PolyML JEdit Plugin</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

The JEdit PolyML Plugin provides <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">JEdit</a>
with features for editing, compiling, and examining SML Code.
&nbsp;It requires that <a href="http://www.polyml.org/">PolyML</a>
5.3 or later is installed. The plugin and PolyML IDE mode has been developed and is being
supported by <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ldixon/">Lucas
Dixon</a> and David Matthews. The project is open-source, under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser General Public License</a>, and is hosted by sourceforge at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyml/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyml/</a> <br>

<h2>Installing</h2>

The plugin is a self-contained jar file, but assumes you have installed
<a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> (tested on
version 4.3 pre 16) as well as <a href="http://www.polyml.org/">PolyML</a>
(tested with version 5.3). Currently, it also uses the jEdit <a href="http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?ErrorList">ErrorList plugin</a>, so you will need to install that first. This can be done easily using the Plugin Manager within jEdit. <br>
<br>
To install the PolyML plugin, you need to place it into
either your jEdit's "<code>jars</code>" subdirectory of its install directory, or your user account's jEdit "<code>jars</code>" subdirectory - in unix systems this is "<code>.jedit/jars</code>". When you then startup jEdit you should have a new menu item within the&nbsp;<code>Plugins</code> menu called&nbsp;<code>PolyML-Plugin</code>. <br>
<h2>Features of the Plugin</h2>
<h3>Shell buffer</h3>
The shell buffer gives you a terminal within a buffer much like emacs
shell mode. Within this buffer there is a prompt and all text after the
prompt is considered as input and can be sent to the underlying
(PolyML) process. All output from the underlying PolyML process is
printed at the start of the shell-prompt. You have all the normal
editing tools for that buffer.&nbsp;<br>
<h3>PolyML IDE protocol</h3>
The PolyML Plugin provide a method to interact with PolyML's IDE protocol. This allows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>the parsing/type-checking/evaluation of buffers by ML. Error
messages and warnings displayed in the ErrorList panel, provided by the
ErrorList plugin;</li>
  <li>get the type of a value;</li>
  <li>get the location where a value is declared, the structure in
which it is defined, and if it has been introduced by an open, you can
also get the location of the open statement;</li>
  <li>the user can move around the parse-tree.</li>
</ul>
These functions are all available from the PolyML-Plugin sub-menu of
the Plugins menu. You can assign the functions useful shortcuts from
jEdit's Global Options (in the Utilities menu).
